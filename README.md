# biotablero_api
API for Biotablero at Instituto Alexander von Humboldt/Rsensus Lab @ Temple University 
# Purpose
Documentation for setting up and maintaining the biotablero backwend infrastructure, including data update and expansion, and the introduction of new capabilities (accept raster data and return imagey) and aiming to finally integrating this with the rest of the biotablero infrastructured managed by Instituto Humboldt.

## Introduction and Origin
## Main Components

Backend Biotablero (Ivan' product), can extract and calculate diverse ecological metrics form some datasets using uploaded or drwawn polygons. 
It can work in two ways. First for a general second-thier user basedo on a gui and simple, direct queries.
Nevertheless: it should be able to provide at least *some* visualization of the calculated metric (can it define the symbology?) and the possibility to download the data. (a least tables) and screenshots (jpeg) with the data and citation.

A solution for first level users, in which relatively easy they can get and manipulate the area in a more "raw" version useful for other kind of queries and the production of reports that can be used and backed in some way (thus, we really need to pay attention to the validation. Do not commit commission/ommission errors and whst implications does this have (legitimacy, legality, real support to the decision masking process)

## Included  Indicators
## Update if information.
 1. Prepare and homologue the new armonized data to Add the new armonized data
 2. Load into the Instance and store it in the roght directory
 3. Update the code (app.R and biotablero_api.r and the other) to deal wit hthe new dataset(s)
 4. Get it to work
 5. Updatethe existing IDEAM data.

## Further Development 

Introduction of new capabilities (accept raster data and return imagey) and aiming to finally integrating this with the rest of the biotablero infrastructured managed by Instituto Humboldt.
